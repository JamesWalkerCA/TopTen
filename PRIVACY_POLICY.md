## TopTen Application: Privacy policy

Welcome to the TopTen app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by jswalkerca@gmail.com. The app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. App does not collect any user data.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
